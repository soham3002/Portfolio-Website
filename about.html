      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Soham Rajam</strong>, a passionate Full Stack Web Developer with a deep love for coding. My journey in technology began at an early age, and since then, I have dedicated myself to mastering both front-end and back-end technologies. I believe that technology has the power to shape the future, and I strive to be a part of that transformation by creating innovative and functional web applications.</p>

      <p>I am proficient in a variety of programming languages such as <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Express.js</strong>, and <strong>MongoDB</strong>, allowing me to work on both the client and server sides of applications. My skill set also includes experience with <strong>databases</strong> like <strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>.</p>

      <p>My passion for coding isn't just about building products, but about solving real-world problems. I love crafting applications that are not only functional but also intuitive and user-friendly. I’m constantly exploring new technologies and frameworks to stay ahead of the curve and enhance the quality of the projects I work on.</p>

      <p>In addition to my technical expertise, I have a strong interest in <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>natural language processing (NLP)</strong>, which I actively study to incorporate advanced features into web applications. I aim to bridge the gap between traditional web development and the future of intelligent applications.</p>

      <p>Beyond coding, I’m also a big advocate for clean and efficient code, as well as strong collaboration skills within development teams. I enjoy working in an agile environment, where I can contribute to every stage of development, from ideation to deployment.</p>

      <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me exploring new tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or attending hackathons and tech meetups. My ultimate goal is to work on projects that have a positive impact on people's lives and make the digital world a more connected place.</p>
